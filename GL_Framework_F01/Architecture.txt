MyTemplate<X> and MyTemplate<Y> are completely unrelated classes even if X and Y are related!


Application:
- pointers to all managers, processors, windows, scenes
-- owing unique_prt where it makes semse (e.g. managers, processors, scenes)
- getter functions to get these pointers

- pointer to it's parent application
--> every constructor requires application pointer!


Finding the matching component processors etc:
- go to parent application -> call the corresponding getter
